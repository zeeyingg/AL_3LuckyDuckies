APCS Lab 02
Period 8
Wrapper Classes and Search Types
2021 - 12 - 12
Time Spent: 5 hours

DISCO: 
- (Look at the compareTo method) 
  It appears that by using a non-static method declaration with two arguments, 
  it is possible to invoke said method on the first argument, using the second argument as an argument the normal way.
  This gets around the issue of this being of and unspecified type. 

QCC:
Why is our code sometimes producing an infinite while loop, and how can we stop this?
Why are we still getting exceptions some of the time of adding index out of bounds on addBinary?
What is the best/smartest/cleanest way to do this lab?


NOTES TO MYKOLYK (AND TO SELVES): 
- Plans in plans.pdf are in order, with the most recent at the top and the least recent at the bottom. All plans are included. 


TO DO ON MONDAY: 

// 1. Run ALTester; make sure that inOrder() works
2. Initialize a new OrderedArrayList to ... 
3. ... test addOrd
4. Once that works, test the overwritten constructor using ArrayList<Integer> bob
5. Write and test find(int value)
6. Write and test removeOrd(int value)
6. Write and test replace(int value, int newValue)
